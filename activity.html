    <h2>About AI</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating machines
         that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include
          learning from experience, recognizing patterns, solving problems, understanding natural
           language, and making decisions. AI systems use techniques such as machine learning, deep
            learning, and neural networks to analyze data and improve their performance over time.
             As AI continues to evolve, it is becoming an essential part of modern technology, 
              driving innovations in many industries and changing the way people interact with
               machines.

    <p>The uses of AI are vast and rapidly expanding. In healthcare, AI assists doctors by analyzing 
        medical images, predicting diseases, and personalizing treatment plans. In business,
         it helps automate processes, improve customer service through chatbots, and analyze
          large datasets to guide decision-making. AI is also transforming industries like 
          transportation, through self-driving cars, and education, by providing personalized 
          learning experiences. Additionally, AI powers virtual assistants, facial recognition, 
          and recommendation systems on platforms like Netflix and Amazon, making everyday life more
         convenient and
         efficient.</p>
